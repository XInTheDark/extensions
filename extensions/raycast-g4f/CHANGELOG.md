## Raycast-G4F Changelog

### 2024-03-15: Add image generation capabilities
GPT4Free just got more powerful with FREE, unlimited image generation support!
The command added is "Generate Images", which opens a chat view similar to AI Chat. The images are displayed in a grid view.

The default model used is `Prodia`, also using the g4f-ts module.

### 2024-03-15: Provider and model updates
2 more providers were added: Bing and ChatBase. A preference is provided to switch between the 3 available providers.
The GPT provider now gives access to the gpt-4-32k model, which is GPT-4 with a larger context window - so your
chats can now be longer and more detailed.
